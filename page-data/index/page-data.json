Meanwhile, Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications\nleverages the power of IBM's Granite foundation large language model to\nprovide features such as code change explanation, migrating projects\nfrom the **WebSphere Application Server** to **WebSphere Liberty**, upgrade the Maven Liberty project to the latest Java\nversion, and create integration tests for specific use cases. By using\nthis tool, Java developers can expect improvements in their coding speed\nand efficiency.\n\n\n## About this hands-on lab\n\nThe objective of this hands-on lab is to provide an end-to-end overview of the functionalities offered by Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications. The use cases explored in the lab are as follows:\n\n1. **Modernize to Liberty**\n\n  Modernizing Java enterprise applications to run on modern runtimes is a critical area of focus for businesses. Modern lightweight runtimes like WebSphere Liberty offer a number of advantages including reduced footprint, faster startup times and overall performance. They also enable new microservice based architectures and the operational efficiencies that result from that. \n  For this use case, you will take an application that is built for traditional IBM WebSphere Application Server, and deploy it on WebSphere Liberty. Using a migration bundle from IBM Transformation Advisor, you will add the necessary configuration to the application. You will review the analysis that identifies the issues that must be addressed before the application will function correctly on WebSphere Liberty.\n  Using a combination of automation and Watsonx AI, you will fix the code issues that were identified and deploy the application to WebSphere Liberty using Liberty dev tools. For this use case, you will use the Eclipse IDE and the Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications Eclipse plugin.\n\n2. **Upgrade Java Version**\n\n  Upgrades to Java versions used by applications are necessary over time. This is important as older Java versions may no longer receive security updates and developers may want to leverage the latest features in newer Java versions. In this use case, you will upgrade an application from Java 8 to Java 21. Watsonx Code Assistant will identify the code issues that need to be addressed, and using a combination of automation and Watsonx AI, you will fix the code issues that were identified. The updated application will be tested on WebSphere Liberty using Liberty dev tools. For this use case, you will use the VS Code IDE and the Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications VS Code plugin.\n\nAdditionally, the lab will introduce AI features such as **code change explanation** to help you to understand the nature of the changes that have been made to the code, and **unit test generation** to automate the process of generating test code.\n\n\n# Getting started\n\nThis subsection will guide you through the steps required to start up the lab environment with IBM Technology Zone.\n\n## Accessing the lab environment\n\n1. Locate and expand the reservation menu on the lab page.\n2. Click on the **Console** button to launch the VM. For easier navigation, you can select **Full Screen** or **Open in a New Window**.\n\n     <div align=\"center\">\n         <img src=\"../images/media/console_button.png\" alt=\"Console Button\" />\n     </div>\n\n3. When prompted, enter the password provided by your instructor to log in to the VM.\n\n## Setting up your workspace in the VM\n\n1. Access the lab instructions\n\n   To follow the lab efficiently, open your preferred browser (Firefox or Chrome) within the VM and use the bookmark named **IBM TechXchange 2024 — Lab 1596 - Hands-on Watsonx Code Assistance for Enterprise Java Applications Lab** in the browser's bookmark bar to access the instructions alongside your IDE window.\n   \n    <div style=\"border-left: 4px solid #d3d3d3; padding-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n        <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: If you need to transfer text from your local browser into the VM, you can use the <strong>Send Text</strong> feature:</p>\n        <ol>\n            <li>Copy the desired text from the Lab Guide in your local browser.</li>\n            <li>Click on the area within the VM where you want to paste the text.</li>\n            <li>Click the <strong>Send Text</strong> button located in the VM command bar.</li>\n            <div align=\"center\">\n                <img src=\"../images/media/send_text_button.png\" alt=\"Send Text Button\" width=\"500\" />\n            </div>\n            <li>Paste the copied text into the <strong>Send Text</strong> window that appears.</li>\n            <li>Click the <strong>Fast Send Text</strong> button to input the text into the VM.</li>\n        </ol>\n    </div>\n\n2.  Adjust the desktop to fit your screen\n\n    If the desktop does not fit your display, you can resize it by clicking the **Resize** button located in the VM command bar. For the best experience, a minimum resolution of 1920x1080 is recommended.\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"../images/media/image9.png\" alt=\"Resize Button\" width=\"300\" />\n    </div>\n\n## Viewing the application versions\n    \nLocate and open the folder named **Demo_Lab**, which can be found either on the **Windows Desktop** or in the **Quick Access** menu of File Explorer.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"../images/media/folder_location.png\" />\n</div>\n\nInside the **Demo_Lab** folder, you will find the following versions of the lab application:\n\n  - **Completed_Version**: A complete version of the lab demonstrating the application after migrating from WebSphere Application Server to WebSphere Liberty and upgrading to Java 21.\n\n  - **Modernize_to_Liberty**: This basic version of the lab features source code that is incompatible with Liberty and utilizes Java 8, which is not compatible with Java 21. This will serve as the starting point for the lab.\n\n  - **Upgrade_Java**: A work-in-progress version of the lab demonstrating the application after migrating to WebSphere Liberty but still utilizing Java 8.\n\n# Experiencing Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications\n\nThis section will provide guidance on the usage of the features of Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications.\n\n## WebSphere Application Server modernization to Liberty with Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications Eclipse IDE plugin\n\nFirst, let’s start with **Eclipse IDE**. Please Locate and launch the Eclipse IDE from the Windows task bar.\n\n1. After launching Eclipse, the directory **D:\n    \\Demo_Lab\\Modernize_to_Liberty** should be set as default workspace directory.\n    If it is not, please manually select the **Modernize_to_Liberty** as the directory. \n    You should see that the **sample-app-mod** have been imported into the IDE. If the project was not imported automatically,\n    please import it as a Maven project by going to the\n    **File** drop-down menu in the top left corner, then selecting\n    **Import -\\> Maven -\\> Existing Maven Projects**.\n\n2.  To ensure that the project is properly configured with the\n    dependencies for the WebSphere Application Server APIs, please run the following commands in\n    the Windows terminal (accessible via the Windows taskbar) to install\n    the required dependencies into your local Maven project.\n\n    ```bash\n    d:\n\n    cd d:\\Demo_Lab\\Modernize_to_Liberty\\sample-app-mod\n\n    mvn install:install-file -Dfile=\"was_dependency/was_public.jar\" -DpomFile=\"was-dependency/was_public-9.0.0.pom\"\n    ```\n\n3. The application was originally developed using **traditional WebSphere Application Server** code. With **Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications**, you can leverage an AI-powered feature to modernize the application for the latest **WebSphere Liberty Server**. To initiate this process, right-click on the project and select **Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications** → **Modernize to Liberty**. This will open the **Watsonx Code Assistant** extension interface.\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"../images/media/image11.png\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <div style=\"border-left: 4px solid #d3d3d3; padding-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n        <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Before proceeding to the next step, ensure you see the console message <strong>Retrieving the analysis report completed</strong>.</p>\n        <div align=\"center\">\n            <img src=\"../images/media/retrieving_report_complete.png\" alt=\"Retrieving the analysis report complete\" />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n4.  The tool has two options to migrate the project to Liberty, you can either **upload the migration bundle** which will provide Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications with analysis and important configuration files to migrate to WebSphere Liberty or use the **binary scanner** if a migration bundle is not available. Note that using the migration bundle is recommended because it has been generated with the configuration information from where the Java application is running, while the binary scanner will not be able to obtain this information. The migration bundle option will be used in this demo. Please locate and open the bundle provided in the project folder (**d:\\Demo_Lab\\Modernize_to_Liberty\\sample-app-mod\\migration-bundle\\modresorts.ear_migrationBundle.zip**)\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"../images/media/image12.png\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"../images/media/image13.png\" />\n    </div>\n\n5. Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications will extract configuration files, including `server.xml` and `Containerfile`, from the migration bundle. The `server.xml` file contains the application's configuration, while the `Containerfile` can be used to build a Liberty image of your application. After reviewing these files, add them to the project folder by clicking on **Add Files to Project** to apply the changes.\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"../images/media/image14.png\" />\n    </div>\n\n6.  Next, a modernization issues list will be presented with the must fix issue detected by Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications. You can review each issue in detail by clicking on the expand button on the right-hand side of each item. The **Additional information** tab highlights other issues you should be aware of when migrating your application, though these do not require code changes. After the review is complete, click the **Run auto-fixes** button to apply the necessary changes.\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"../images/media/image15.png\" />\n    </div>\n\n7.  After the auto-fix is completed, click on **Build and Refresh** to\n    refresh the list.\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"../images/media/image16.png\" />\n    </div>\n\n8.  An issue has been marked as **Assisted-fix**, indicating that a code change is required, and that Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications can help us make the required change. Click on the drop-down icon on the issue tab to view the details of the issue. To locate the issue occurrence, click on the `View analysis report` link seen circled. This will open an HTML analysis report in the external browser.

Open the **src/main/java/com/acme/modres/UpperServlet.java** file and locate the **doGet()** method (lines 19 to 33). Select this code block, then click the **Help me** button in the issue list. The chat window will provide a suggested solution, which includes a new method called **escapeHTML()** and an updated **doGet()** method. \n  \n   The updated **doGet()** method uses the new **escapeHTML()** method to replace the existing **ResponseUtils.encodeDataString()** call. Copy both the **escapeHTML()** method and the updated **doGet()** method from the chat window. Then, replace the original **doGet()** method in the source code and add the new **escapeHTML()** method. Save the changes once done.\n\n    <div style=\"border-left: 4px solid #d3d3d3; padding-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n        <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: To implement the new method in your code, simply hover your mouse over the top right corner of each answer, then use the <strong>Page</strong> button to copy and paste.</p>\n        <div align=\"center\">\n            <img src=\"../images/media/copy_and_paste_button.png\" alt=\"Copy and Paste Button\" />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n10. Click on the **Build and Refresh** button to re-verify the changes.\n    All the listed issue should be resolved.\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"../images/media/image18.png\" />\n    </div>\n\n11. You can review the recent code changes by enabling the Explain Code Changes feature.

The code assistant scans the project and presents the code change explanation in a pop-up extension window.\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"../images/media/eclipse_code_change_explain.png\" />\n    </div>\n\n    After you review the explanation, you can click **Save Summary** button at the bottom to store the explanation in a local file.\n\n12. Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications explain code feature provides helps in understanding the\n    entire code base. To use this feature in the **current** project,\n    right-click on the **sample-app-mod** and select **Explain Code**.\n    \n    The code assistant then scans the application to identify the system\n    dependency graph associated with each class, subsequently providing\n    a detailed description in the extension’s chat panel in terms of the\n    application overview and explanation for each constituent services.\n    This process may take several minutes to complete.\n    \n    After you review the explanation, you can click **Save Explanation**\n    to store the explanation in a local file.\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"../images/media/image19.png\" />\n    </div>\n\n13. To confirm the migration is completed, you can add the Liberty maven\n    plugin in the **pom.xml** file\n\n    ```bash\n    <plugin>\n        <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>\n        <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>\n        <version>3.10.3</version>\n    </plugin>\n    ```\n\n14. Then, try to run the application in Liberty developer mode in the\n    same terminal used in step 2. To view the application, please visit\n    <http://localhost:9080/resorts>.\n\n    ```bash\n    mvn liberty:dev\n    ```\n\n15. After you are finished checking out the application, stop the\n    Liberty instance by pressing **CTRL+C** in the command-line session\n    where you ran Liberty. Alternatively, you can run the\n    **liberty:stop** goal from the current directory in another shell\n    session:\n\n    ```bash\n    mvn liberty:stop\n    ```\n\n## Java version upgrade for application with Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications VSCode IDE plugin\n\nYou may close the project in Eclipse IDE and switch over to use **VSCode\nIDE**. Please Locate and launch the VSCode IDE from the Windows task bar.\n\n1.  For VSCode IDE, the **Upgrade\\_Java** directory should be imported and available to use. If this is not the case, select the **Upgrade\\_Java** directory or navigate to D:\\Demo_Lab\\Upgrade_Java\\sample-app-mod\n\n2. Start the application by launching it in Liberty Developer Mode, run\n    the following command in the terminal:\n\n    ```bash\n    d:\n    \n    cd d:\\Demo_Lab\\Upgrade_Java\\sample-app-mod\n    \n    mvn clean package\n\n    mvn liberty:dev\n    ```\n\n    To access the application, navigate to <http://localhost:9080/resorts.>\n    Then, click on the **Where to?** drop-down menu button. The weather\n    information does not seem to load correctly.

Meanwhile, Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications\nleverages the power of IBM's Granite foundation large language model to\nprovide features such as code change explanation, migrating projects\nfrom the **WebSphere Application Server** to **WebSphere Liberty**, upgrade the Maven Liberty project to the latest Java\nversion, and create integration tests for specific use cases. By using\nthis tool, Java developers can expect improvements in their coding speed\nand efficiency.\n\n\n## About this hands-on lab\n\nThe objective of this hands-on lab is to provide an end-to-end overview of the functionalities offered by Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications. The use cases explored in the lab are as follows:\n\n1. **Modernize to Liberty**\n\n  Modernizing Java enterprise applications to run on modern runtimes is a critical area of focus for businesses. Modern lightweight runtimes like WebSphere Liberty offer a number of advantages including reduced footprint, faster startup times and overall performance. They also enable new microservice based architectures and the operational efficiencies that result from that. \n  For this use case, you will take an application that is built for traditional IBM WebSphere Application Server, and deploy it on WebSphere Liberty. Using a migration bundle from IBM Transformation Advisor, you will add the necessary configuration to the application. You will review the analysis that identifies the issues that must be addressed before the application will function correctly on WebSphere Liberty.\n  Using a combination of automation and Watsonx AI, you will fix the code issues that were identified and deploy the application to WebSphere Liberty using Liberty dev tools. For this use case, you will use the Eclipse IDE and the Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications Eclipse plugin.\n\n2. **Upgrade Java Version**\n\n  Upgrades to Java versions used by applications are necessary over time. This is important as older Java versions may no longer receive security updates and developers may want to leverage the latest features in newer Java versions. In this use case, you will upgrade an application from Java 8 to Java 21. Watsonx Code Assistant will identify the code issues that need to be addressed, and using a combination of automation and Watsonx AI, you will fix the code issues that were identified. The updated application will be tested on WebSphere Liberty using Liberty dev tools. For this use case, you will use the VS Code IDE and the Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications VS Code plugin.\n\nAdditionally, the lab will introduce AI features such as **code change explanation** to help you to understand the nature of the changes that have been made to the code, and **unit test generation** to automate the process of generating test code.\n\n\n# Getting started\n\nThis subsection will guide you through the steps required to start up the lab environment with IBM Technology Zone.\n\n## Accessing the lab environment\n\n1. Locate and expand the reservation menu on the lab page.\n2. Click on the **Console** button to launch the VM. For easier navigation, you can select **Full Screen** or **Open in a New Window**.\n\n     <div align=\"center\">\n         <img src=\"../images/media/console_button.png\" alt=\"Console Button\" />\n     </div>\n\n3. When prompted, enter the password provided by your instructor to log in to the VM.\n\n## Setting up your workspace in the VM\n\n1. Access the lab instructions\n\n   To follow the lab efficiently, open your preferred browser (Firefox or Chrome) within the VM and use the bookmark named **IBM TechXchange 2024 — Lab 1596 - Hands-on Watsonx Code Assistance for Enterprise Java Applications Lab** in the browser's bookmark bar to access the instructions alongside your IDE window.\n   \n    <div style=\"border-left: 4px solid #d3d3d3; padding-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n        <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: If you need to transfer text from your local browser into the VM, you can use the <strong>Send Text</strong> feature:</p>\n        <ol>\n            <li>Copy the desired text from the Lab Guide in your local browser.</li>\n            <li>Click on the area within the VM where you want to paste the text.</li>\n            <li>Click the <strong>Send Text</strong> button located in the VM command bar.</li>\n            <div align=\"center\">\n                <img src=\"../images/media/send_text_button.png\" alt=\"Send Text Button\" width=\"500\" />\n            </div>\n            <li>Paste the copied text into the <strong>Send Text</strong> window that appears.</li>\n            <li>Click the <strong>Fast Send Text</strong> button to input the text into the VM.</li>\n        </ol>\n    </div>\n\n2.  Adjust the desktop to fit your screen\n\n    If the desktop does not fit your display, you can resize it by clicking the **Resize** button located in the VM command bar. For the best experience, a minimum resolution of 1920x1080 is recommended.\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"../images/media/image9.png\" alt=\"Resize Button\" width=\"300\" />\n    </div>\n\n## Viewing the application versions\n    \nLocate and open the folder named **Demo_Lab**, which can be found either on the **Windows Desktop** or in the **Quick Access** menu of File Explorer.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"../images/media/folder_location.png\" />\n</div>\n\nInside the **Demo_Lab** folder, you will find the following versions of the lab application:\n\n  - **Completed_Version**: A complete version of the lab demonstrating the application after migrating from WebSphere Application Server to WebSphere Liberty and upgrading to Java 21.\n\n  - **Modernize_to_Liberty**: This basic version of the lab features source code that is incompatible with Liberty and utilizes Java 8, which is not compatible with Java 21. This will serve as the starting point for the lab.\n\n  - **Upgrade_Java**: A work-in-progress version of the lab demonstrating the application after migrating to WebSphere Liberty but still utilizing Java 8.\n\n# Experiencing Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications\n\nThis section will provide guidance on the usage of the features of Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications.\n\n## WebSphere Application Server modernization to Liberty with Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications Eclipse IDE plugin\n\nFirst, let’s start with **Eclipse IDE**. Please Locate and launch the Eclipse IDE from the Windows task bar.\n\n1. After launching Eclipse, the directory **D:\n    \\Demo_Lab\\Modernize_to_Liberty** should be set as default workspace directory.\n    If it is not, please manually select the **Modernize_to_Liberty** as the directory. \n    You should see that the **sample-app-mod** have been imported into the IDE. If the project was not imported automatically,\n    please import it as a Maven project by going to the\n    **File** drop-down menu in the top left corner, then selecting\n    **Import -\\> Maven -\\> Existing Maven Projects**.\n\n2.  To ensure that the project is properly configured with the\n    dependencies for the WebSphere Application Server APIs, please run the following commands in\n    the Windows terminal (accessible via the Windows taskbar) to install\n    the required dependencies into your local Maven project.\n\n    ```bash\n    d:\n\n    cd d:\\Demo_Lab\\Modernize_to_Liberty\\sample-app-mod\n\n    mvn install:install-file -Dfile=\"was_dependency/was_public.jar\" -DpomFile=\"was-dependency/was_public-9.0.0.pom\"\n    ```\n\n3. The application was originally developed using **traditional WebSphere Application Server** code. With **Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications**, you can leverage an AI-powered feature to modernize the application for the latest **WebSphere Liberty Server**. To initiate this process, right-click on the project and select **Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications** → **Modernize to Liberty**. This will open the **Watsonx Code Assistant** extension interface.\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"../images/media/image11.png\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <div style=\"border-left: 4px solid #d3d3d3; padding-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n        <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Before proceeding to the next step, ensure you see the console message <strong>Retrieving the analysis report completed</strong>.</p>\n        <div align=\"center\">\n            <img src=\"../images/media/retrieving_report_complete.png\" alt=\"Retrieving the analysis report complete\" />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n4.  The tool has two options to migrate the project to Liberty, you can either **upload the migration bundle** which will provide Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications with analysis and important configuration files to migrate to WebSphere Liberty or use the **binary scanner** if a migration bundle is not available. Note that using the migration bundle is recommended because it has been generated with the configuration information from where the Java application is running, while the binary scanner will not be able to obtain this information. The migration bundle option will be used in this demo. Please locate and open the bundle provided in the project folder (**d:\\Demo_Lab\\Modernize_to_Liberty\\sample-app-mod\\migration-bundle\\modresorts.ear_migrationBundle.zip**)\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"../images/media/image12.png\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"../images/media/image13.png\" />\n    </div>\n\n5. Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications will extract configuration files, including `server.xml` and `Containerfile`, from the migration bundle. The `server.xml` file contains the application's configuration, while the `Containerfile` can be used to build a Liberty image of your application. After reviewing these files, add them to the project folder by clicking on **Add Files to Project** to apply the changes.\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"../images/media/image14.png\" />\n    </div>\n\n6.  Next, a modernization issues list will be presented with the must fix issue detected by Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications. You can review each issue in detail by clicking on the expand button on the right-hand side of each item. The **Additional information** tab highlights other issues you should be aware of when migrating your application, though these do not require code changes. After the review is complete, click the **Run auto-fixes** button to apply the necessary changes.\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"../images/media/image15.png\" />\n    </div>\n\n7.  After the auto-fix is completed, click on **Build and Refresh** to\n    refresh the list.\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"../images/media/image16.png\" />\n    </div>\n\n8.  An issue has been marked as **Assisted-fix**, indicating that a code change is required, and that Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications can help us make the required change. Click on the drop-down icon on the issue tab to view the details of the issue. To locate the issue occurrence, click on the `View analysis report` link seen circled.

Open the **src/main/java/com/acme/modres/UpperServlet.java** file and locate the **doGet()** method (lines 19 to 33). Select this code block, then click the **Help me** button in the issue list. The chat window will provide a suggested solution, which includes a new method called **escapeHTML()** and an updated **doGet()** method. \n  \n   The updated **doGet()** method uses the new **escapeHTML()** method to replace the existing **ResponseUtils.encodeDataString()** call. Copy both the **escapeHTML()** method and the updated **doGet()** method from the chat window. Then, replace the original **doGet()** method in the source code and add the new **escapeHTML()** method. Save the changes once done.\n\n    <div style=\"border-left: 4px solid #d3d3d3; padding-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n        <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: To implement the new method in your code, simply hover your mouse over the top right corner of each answer, then use the <strong>Page</strong> button to copy and paste.</p>\n        <div align=\"center\">\n            <img src=\"../images/media/copy_and_paste_button.png\" alt=\"Copy and Paste Button\" />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n10. Click on the **Build and Refresh** button to re-verify the changes.\n    All the listed issue should be resolved.\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"../images/media/image18.png\" />\n    </div>\n\n11. You can review the recent code changes by enabling the Explain Code Changes feature.

The code assistant scans the project and presents the code change explanation in a pop-up extension window.\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"../images/media/eclipse_code_change_explain.png\" />\n    </div>\n\n    After you review the explanation, you can click **Save Summary** button at the bottom to store the explanation in a local file.\n\n12. Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications explain code feature provides helps in understanding the\n    entire code base. To use this feature in the **current** project,\n    right-click on the **sample-app-mod** and select **Explain Code**.\n    \n    The code assistant then scans the application to identify the system\n    dependency graph associated with each class, subsequently providing\n    a detailed description in the extension’s chat panel in terms of the\n    application overview and explanation for each constituent services.\n    This process may take several minutes to complete.\n    \n    After you review the explanation, you can click **Save Explanation**\n    to store the explanation in a local file.\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"../images/media/image19.png\" />\n    </div>\n\n13. To confirm the migration is completed, you can add the Liberty maven\n    plugin in the **pom.xml** file\n\n    ```bash\n    <plugin>\n        <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>\n        <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>\n        <version>3.10.3</version>\n    </plugin>\n    ```\n\n14. Then, try to run the application in Liberty developer mode in the\n    same terminal used in step 2. To view the application, please visit\n    <http://localhost:9080/resorts>.\n\n    ```bash\n    mvn liberty:dev\n    ```\n\n15. After you are finished checking out the application, stop the\n    Liberty instance by pressing **CTRL+C** in the command-line session\n    where you ran Liberty. Alternatively, you can run the\n    **liberty:stop** goal from the current directory in another shell\n    session:\n\n    ```bash\n    mvn liberty:stop\n    ```\n\n## Java version upgrade for application with Watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications VSCode IDE plugin\n\nYou may close the project in Eclipse IDE and switch over to use **VSCode\nIDE**. Please Locate and launch the VSCode IDE from the Windows task bar.\n\n1.  For VSCode IDE, the **Upgrade\\_Java** directory should be imported and available to use. If this is not the case, select the **Upgrade\\_Java** directory or navigate to D:\\Demo_Lab\\Upgrade_Java\\sample-app-mod\n\n2. Start the application by launching it in Liberty Developer Mode, run\n    the following command in the terminal:\n\n    ```bash\n    d:\n    \n    cd d:\\Demo_Lab\\Upgrade_Java\\sample-app-mod\n    \n    mvn clean package\n\n    mvn liberty:dev\n    ```\n\n    To access the application, navigate to <http://localhost:9080/resorts.>\n    Then, click on the **Where to?** drop-down menu button. The weather\n    information does not seem to load correctly.
